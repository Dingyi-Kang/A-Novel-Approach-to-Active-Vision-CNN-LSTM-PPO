A Novel Approach to Active Vision: Integrating Attention-based Predictive Learning with Reinforcement Learning
===

# Introduction
**This project contains two models. The first model integrates CNN-LSTM neural network with PPO algorithm, demonstrating exceptinal performance in track target tasks. The second model which is still under development aims to achieve state-of-art performance through integrating attention-based predictive learning with reinforcement learning**

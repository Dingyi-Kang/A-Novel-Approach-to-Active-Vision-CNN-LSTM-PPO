A Novel Approach to Active Vision: Integrating Attention-based Predictive Learning with Reinforcement Learning
===

# Introduction
**This project encompasses two models. The first model integrates a CNN-LSTM neural network with the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm, demonstrating exceptional performance in target tracking tasks. The second model, which is still under development, aims to achieve state-of-the-art performance by integrating attention-based predictive learning with reinforcement learning.**

# Model 1 -- CNN-LSTM + PPO
## Architecture
**The first model integrates a CNN-LSTM neural network with the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm, demonstrating exceptional performance in target tracking tasks.**

## Environment
We used the gym-unrealcv 3D environments for tracking tasks developed by Fangwei Zhong.

The **3D environments** are built on Unreal Engine(UE4), which could be flexibly customized to simulate real-world active tracking scenarios.
To run the 3D environments, GPU is necessary.

**Here is the repo containing the the instructions to install and use the 3D environments
